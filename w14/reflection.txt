Please respond thoroughly (at least two sentences for each question) to
the following three questions.

1. Describe an experience you had this semester where you saw the power of
functions.
When working with functions that make computations using mathematical and scientific 
formulas. This demonstrated the versitility of functions that take in parameters and return
values. In lesson 8 we used a lot of functions to compute molecular mass. 
Each function performed a specific task, making the program modular and versatile.


2. In your judgment, what is the value of test functions?
Test functions allow us to ensure that the functions we have will always produce the 
correct results. They enable us to recognize and correct potential errors.
Test funcitons can also help us improve the robustness of our functions.


3. Describe your process for troubleshooting and fixing a program that
has a problem. What is one thing you can do to improve your process?
- I insert print() functions in key areas of my code to keep track of
 the values of certain variables and objects that may relate to the error.
- next I would run the debugger after placing breakpoints in key areas 
 of my code to track changes that may relate to the error.
- I can improve my process by using more of the debugging tool instead of placing print
functions in different areas of my code. The debugging tool is more effective than the
practice of placing print() functions all over my code.
